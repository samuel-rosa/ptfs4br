Description: Collection of pedotransfer functions (PTFs) built using open legacy data collected in the 
   Brazilian territory. PTFs are empirical models estimated to predict the values of soil properties from other
   soil properties and environmental covariates that are easier or cheaper to measure or that are more readily
   available. The present version contains PTFs for predicting carbon and organic matter content.
