The __ptfs4br__ contains a collection of pedotransfer functions (PTFs) -- that is empirical models estimated to
predict the values of soil properties from other soil properties and environmental covariates that are easier 
or cheaper to measure or that are more readily available -- built using open legacy data collected in the 
Brazilian territory. The present version contains PTFs for predicting carbon and organic matter content.

## Installation

The __ptfs4br__ is not on [CRAN][cran] yet.

The development version of __ptfs4br__, available at [GitHub][github], can be downloaded -- using the 
__devtools__ package -- with:

```R
if (!require(devtools)) {
  install.packages(pkgs = "devtools")
}
devtools::install_github(repo = "samuel-rosa/ptfs4br")
```

## How to collaborate

We use the *fork & pull* collaborative development model. This means that you are free to make a parallel copy 
of this repository, change the source code as you see fit, and then *push* the changes to your personal copy of
this repository. All this without requiring any authorization. If the changes you've made to your personal copy
of this repository are interesting and you're willing to share them with us, then just have them pulled -- 
*pull request* -- to this repository. After reviewing the changes, we will decide whether they can be merged --
*merge* -- with the source code of this repository.
